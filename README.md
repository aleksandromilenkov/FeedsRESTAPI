# Feeds REST API

I made MERN application where I'm using React JS for frontend, Express js for backend and MongoDB and Mongoose for the database.  
The backend is a RESTFUL API using the most modern express.js  
This app is for sharing posts ( like news feeds ).  
You first Signup, then Login and now you can read and create posts.  
You can only edit and delete your own posts.  

In this app:  
- I'm using jsonweb token for authenticate the user
- Multer package for uploading images
- Crypted passwords  
- Using Express-validator package to validate the body data when trying to post and patch data
- Pagination for the products page and shop page.
